## ðŸ”¨Usage Example

### Hello World API

To interact with the Hello World API, you can make HTTP GET requests to the following endpoint:

```http
GET /api/v1/hello-world-<variant_number>/
```
Replace <variant_number> with the desired variant number. This API endpoint will respond with a JSON message containing the greeting.

Example of using:

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/hello-world-4/


<div align="center">
  <img src="img_1.png" alt="Description of the image">
</div>


Replace 4 with the desired variant number.

This example assumes that your Django development server is running locally on http://127.0.0.1:8000/. 
Make sure to adjust the URLs accordingly if your setup is different.
